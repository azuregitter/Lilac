Lockdown at Lilac RPG Maker Game<br>
My RM Project I plopped into github to try and learn about git.
# Synopsis
Monsters throughout the Valian Continent have suddenly become more violent. As such, in the interest of safety, it has been deemed by most major cities that only Knights, Adventurers of at least Iron Ranking, or civilians escorted by either of the two may leave city borders. Lower ranking adventurers may only attend to requests that are confined within the city borders. Doria and Janelle are Copper ranked adventurers and Doria none too pleased that their promotion quest has been postponed due to this.
